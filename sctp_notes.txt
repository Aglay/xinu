a SCTP message destined for ANY of our known IPs is accepted--do not bind to a specific IP on ingress (egress can bind arbitrarily)
=> SCTP port matches separate from IP matches(?)

receive window indicates buffer occupancy at the receiver
per-path congestion window is maintained to manage the packets in flight

logical parts of SCTP (RFC 4960 -- pg 11):
- association startup/takedown
- sequence delivery within streams
- user data fragmentation
- acknowledgment and congestion avoidance
- chunk bundling
- packet validation
- path management

State movement:

- Receiver:
  - Start in CLOSED state
    - Recv INIT Chunk, generate Cookie, send INIT ACK Chunk (with State Cookie)
    - Recv COOKIE ECHO (with valid cookie)
      - create the TCB and send COOKIE ACK
    - Now in ESTABLISHED state

- Sender:
  - Start in CLOSED state
    - [User request to associate a connection]
    - Create a TCB, send an INIT to receiver
      - start initialization timer timeout
    - Recv INIT ACK (with cookie)
      - send COOKIE ECHO back with cookie
      - stop init timer/start cookie timer timeout
    - Recv COOKIE ACK
      - stope cookie timer
    - Now in ESTABLISHED state

[Revisit for shutdown states...]

User Commands:
[INITIALIZE] - build up internal data structures
[ABORT] - force abort the connection
[ASSOCIATE] - create a connection with remote host
[SHUTDOWN] - properly shutdown the connection

Association Steps:
 "A wants to connect to Z"
- A sends INIT with verification tag (init_tag[A] = rand(1, 2**32-1))
- Z responds with INIT ACK
  - init_tag[Z] = rand(1, 2**32-1); ver_tag = init_tag[A]
  - state cookie (do not keep state locally)
    + MAC (RFC2104)
	+ timestamp of cookie creation time
	+ lifespan of cookie
	+ info needed to establish connection
	- create temp TCP with info from INIT chunk and INIT ACK chunk
	- in TCB set create time and lifespan to protocol param Valid.Cookie.Life
	- Collect info from TCB to recreate TCB, make MAC from info + secret key
	- Cookie consists of this info and MAC
- A gets INIT ACK, sends COOKIE-ECHO
- Z gets COOKIE_ECHO, (checks)
  - creates TCB, move to ESTABLISHED state, send back COOKIE_ACK + DATA
    chunk
